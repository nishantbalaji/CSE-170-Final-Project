Cafe App

This project was done in React (specifically Next.js) for a few reasons. One, there were a lot of repeating components used in the application, and as such, React allowed me to reuse the components
multiple times. For example, the Item cards were all the same, and I was able to quickly recreate them in React. Next, I was also able to store data in state -- locally. Thus, I was able to 
properly demonstrate how my application would function, and store the selected food and drink items for the cart. This whole process was made much more straightforward with React, and thus I 
opted to use this framework. 

This website should be constrained to an iPhone 14 Pro Max Display (430px x 932px). The app can be run by running `yarn && yarn dev` in the cafe-app directory.
